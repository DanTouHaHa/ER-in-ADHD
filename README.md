# Emotion-Dysregulation-Constitutes-a-Separable-Pathway-to-Attention-Deficit-Hyperactivity-Disorder
Using a large-scale longitudinal sample of adolescents(N=6,053, the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development Study, https://abcdstudy.org/) and an independent clinical sample (263 patients and 409 controls, the ADHD-200clinical dataset, http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/adhd200), we revealed three separable neural-behavioral pathways, including the cognition, motivation and emotion pathways. Notably, the emotion pathway is uniquely associated with immune response. This study provided novel mechanistic insights to understand the ADHD heterogeneity.
